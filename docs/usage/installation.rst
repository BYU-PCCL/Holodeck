============
Installation
============

Holodeck is installed in two portions: a client python library (holodeck) is 
installed first, which downloads world packages. The python portion is very 
small, while the world packages ("binaries") can be several gigabytes.

Requirements
============

- Python 3
- Several gigabytes of storage
- Pip3
- Linux: OpenGL 3+

Install Client via Pip
======================

The latest stable Holodeck package is available in a pip repository:

``pip install holodeck``

Install Client via Git
=======================

To use the latest version of Holodeck, you can install and use Holodeck simply by 
cloning the `BYU-PCCL/holodeck`_ repository, and ensuring it is on your ``sys.path``.

.. TODO: Tag different commits in GitHub so users can easily clone specific versions of Holodeck
